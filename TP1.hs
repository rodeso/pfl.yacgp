-- travelSales :: RoadMap -> Path, given a roadmap, returns a solution of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). In this problem, a traveling salesperson has to visit each city exactly once and come back to the start-
-- ing town. The problem is to find the shortest route, that is, the route whose total distance is minimum. This problem has a known solution using dynamic programming [RL99]. Any optimal TSP path will be ac-
-- cepted and the function only needs to return one of them, so the starting city (which is also the ending city) is left to be chosen by each group. Note that the roadmap might not be a complete graph (i.e. a graph where all
-- vertices are connected to all other vertices). If the graph does not have a TSP path, then return an empty list.
